# BellabeatCaseStudy

## Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

### Background Information 

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products and founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

Bellabeat’s co-founders would like to analyze data from non-Bellabeat fitness devices to see how consumers are using these products. The company hopes to use these insights to help guide new marketing strategies for the company.

In this case study, the following key questions will be answered:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How can these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### Data Preparation 

The data used for this case study can be accessed through Kaggle in 18 CVS files, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

Information regarding minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, steps and sleep monitoring can be found. Altogether, thirty Fitbit users were used in this data collection from a one month period only in 2016. With a sample size of 30, it is important to note that this number is not big enough to be a fair representative of all FitBit users. Demographic information about the users (such as gender and age) was not included, which would have been beneficial for marketing analysis to target specific customers.

As 'git status'dailyActivity_merged.csv  provides a good summary of steps and calories burned and the sleepDay_merged.csv file provides sleep data these are good overall files to use to analyze patricipant usage. As fitness devices are generally used to track overall health and weight, the file weightLogInfo_merged containing weight data will also be used.
